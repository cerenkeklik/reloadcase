run project => ```npm start````

I create folders as assets, components, layout, pages, and utils.

in pages, I create my pages components and handle it with react router dom navigate.
in utils, I create api fetch function.
in layout, there is header and footer. I used this layout in homepage
in components, I locate my subcomponents that in used in pages.
in assets, I create css files, images and icons.

I foldered like that because more clear and easy to understand coding and examining.

I used .env folder for chatgpt turbo api key

I tried to code the same the UI as I could. Just couldnt do lock and scroll right side. I could lock the body scroll and continue to scroll right side. However, I understand that, I should scroll left component and right component should scroll instead left. So this feature is missing.

There was no a UI design for mobile and tablet so I coded it that I like, paying attention to responsiveness.
